Lungo is a simple yet powerful macOS application that prevents your computer from entering sleep mode or starting the screensaver. It is designed for users who need their Mac to remain awake during extended tasks without requiring constant input. The application is minimalistic, reliable, and runs entirely from the menu bar.

With Lungo, you can effortlessly keep your screen active during presentations, reading sessions, coding, or while watching media. It supports all modern Mac models, including those with Apple Silicon chips, and integrates seamlessly with macOS features like Dark Mode and Focus settings.

The tool is particularly useful for professionals who use multiple displays, remote workers participating in long video calls, or anyone who wants to avoid disruptive screen locking. Lungo works silently in the background and can be enabled or disabled with one click.

Lungo does not require complex configuration or system permissions. It is free from ads, trackers, or unnecessary features, making it a trusted choice for Mac users worldwide.
